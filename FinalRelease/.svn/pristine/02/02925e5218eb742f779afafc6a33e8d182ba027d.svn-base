The software is owned by Zichang Guo, Harvey Chen and Litong Shen.
The compatible android version for this project is Android 4.4 or above.

Requirement satisfied:

B Requirements:
Perform red 4-band resistor color band detection  		
Perform blue 4-band resistor color band detection		
Perform green 4-band resistor color band detection		

A Requirements: 
Perform orange 4-band resistor color band detection		
Perform yellow 4-band resistor color band detection		
Perform violet 4-band resistor color band detection		
Perform calculate resistance value based on color bands identified	


Operation steps:
1. Press "Capture" button to enter camera preview mode.
2. Put 1 resistor in front of a white background.
3. Zoom in and make sure the resistor is horizontal. The resistor should be as large as possible and tolerence band(gold or silver color band) should be on the right hand side.
4. After the image is captured, press white circle below the image view to process. It took 2 or 3 seconds to show the result.
5. Press "Capture" button will allow user to reenter camera access mode(back to step 1).
